# coding-interview

Hello and welcome to your coding interview üëã.

In this interview we try to find out if your technical skill set is a match for
our team. We will go with you through a set of tasks which we ask you to solve.
The coding interview should resemble a typical pair-programming situation.
Therefore you can use all the tools available and the internet. We would like
to understand what you are thinking when you are typing, so please be verbose üó£Ô∏è.

Don't worry if you are running out of time. The goal is **NOT** to finish all
tasks. We might ask you spontaneous questions which might mean that you can not
finish.

* Time: 30 minutes
* Allowed: Everything!
* Required on your side:
  * (_Python_) Python > 3
  * (_JavaScript_) node.js > 12 (ECMAScript 6) or use [es6console.com](https://es6console.com/)
  * Git > 2.0
  * Skype (not Skype for business)
  * Headset
  * Microphone
  * Webcam (optional)

In this interview we kindly ask you to share your screen with us. It is perfectly
OK for us if you prefer not to enable your camera. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Please close
all applications which might pop up during the Interview. We are not interested
in reading your personal email.

Please don't hesitate to ask us questions about the interview now. If you don't
have any, take a deep breath and lets get cracking. You can do this üöÄ!
